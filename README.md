## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Jquery to fecth data from file.

### What I learned

    - Got better understanding in Jquery with usage of JQuery.

### Continued development

    - Got better at using width and measurement units to support responsiveness, but still think I need more practise at using measurements like rem, vh, etc., to support better responsiveness.
    - I still think I can do lot better for responsiveness and also to pick the max value from data for optimization.
